# Week_2_Rproject
R has in built datasets available in it from which I used BullTroutRML2.
The dataset provided many visualizations and filteration.
By summarizing the datset, I acquired Mean, Median, Mode and so on
The visualization has a linear relationship between Age and Fork Length.
Histogram unfolds that most of the species frequency lies in between 0 and 10.
